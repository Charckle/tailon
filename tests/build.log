export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

Note that since Go 1.17 installing packages with go get is deprecated:
Use go install instead:

#do
go install github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen/cmd/vfsgendev@latest
#after this vfsgendev binary appears inside ~/go/bin


export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

export GOOS=linux
export GOARCH=amd64
make
