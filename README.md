# Tailon

Tailon is a webapp for looking at and searching through files and streams. In a
nutshell, it is a fancy web wrapper around the following commands:

```
tail -f
tail -f | grep
tail -f | awk
tail -f | sed
```

What sets tailon apart from other similar projects is:

* Fully self-contained executable.
* Small footprint. The tailon executable sits at 2.5MB in size and uses 10MB of RSS.
* Responsive and minimal user-interface.

## Install

Download a build for your platform from the [releases] page or install using `go get`:

```
go get -u github.com/gvalkov/tailon-next
```

A docker image is also available:

```
docker run --rm gvalkov/tailon --help
```

## Usage

Tailon is a command-line program that spawns a local HTTP server, which in turn
streams the output of commands such as `tail` and `grep`. It can be configured
from its command-line interface or through the convenience of a [toml] config
file.

To get started, run tailon with the list of files that you wish to monitor.

```
tailon /var/log/apache/access.log /var/log/apache/error.log /var/log/messages
```

Tailon can serve single files, globs or whole directory trees. Tailonâ€™s
server-side functionality is summarized entirely in its help message:

[//]: # (run "make README.md" to update the next section with the output of tailon --help)

[//]: # (BEGIN HELP)
```
Usage: tailon [options] -c <config file>
Usage: tailon [options] <filespec> [<filespec> ...]

Tailon is a webapp for looking at and searching through files and streams.

  -a, --allow-download         allow file downloads (default true)
  -b, --bind string            Listen on the specified address and port (default ":8080")
  -c, --config string
  -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit
  -e, --help-config            Show configuration file help and exit
  -r, --relative-root string   webapp relative root (default "/")

Tailon can be configured through a config file or with command-line flags.

The command-line interface expects one or more filespec arguments, which
specify the files or directories to be served. The expected format is:

  [[glob|dir|file],alias=name,group=name,]<path>

The default filespec is 'file' and points to a single, possibly non-existent
file. The file name in the UI can be overwritten with the 'alias=' specifier.

The 'glob' filespec evaluates to the list of files that match a shell file
name pattern. The pattern is evaluated each time the file list is refreshed.
An 'alias' specifier overwrites the parent directory of each matched file in
the UI. Note that quoting is necessary to prevent shell expansion.

  tailon "glob,/var/log/apache/*.log" "glob,alias=apache,/var/log/apache/*.log"

The 'dir' specifier evaluates to all files in a directory.

  tailon dir,/var/log/apache

The "group=" specifier sets the group in which files appear in the file
dropdown of the UI.

Example usage:
  tailon file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
  tailon alias=messages,/var/log/messages "glob:/var/log/*.log"
  tailon -b localhost:8080 -c config.toml

For information on usage through the configuration file, please refer to the
'--help-config' option.
```
[//]: # (END HELP)

## Security

Tailon runs commands on the server it is installed on. While commands that
accept a script argument (such as awk, sed and grep) should be invulnerable to
shell injection, they may still allow for arbitrary command execution and
unrestricted access to the filesystem.

To clarify this point, consider the following input to the sed command:

```
s/a/b'; cat /etc/secrets
```

This will result in an error, as tailon does not invoke commands through a
shell. On the other hand, the following command is a perfectly valid sed script
that has the same effect as the above attempt for shell injection:

```
r /etc/secrets
```

The default set of enabled commands - tail, grep and awk - should be safe to
use. GNU awk is run in [sandbox] mode, which prevents scripts from accessing your
system, either through the system() builtin or by using input redirection.

By default, tailon is accessible to anyone who knows the server address and
port. Basic and digest authentication are under development.


## What about the other tailon project?

Tailon-next is a full rewrite of the original [tailon] with the following goals in mind:

* Easier maintenance for the maintainer.
* Remove unwanted features and fix poor design choices.
* Learn more.

In terms of tech, the following has changed:

* Backend from Python+Tornado to Go.
* Frontend from a very-custom and specific Typescript solution to a simple ES5 + vue.js
  (mostly for data-binding).
* Simplified asset pipeline (a short Makefile).
* Config file is now toml.
* Fully self contained
